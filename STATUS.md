Cassette AI viability sprint status

## Acoustic data-over-sound modem + cassette-in-the-loop (2026-06-07)
Built a working OFDM acoustic modem and proved a real cassette stores/returns digital
data **byte-exact**, read back acoustically (no special hardware).
- Paths proven: laptop speaker -> air -> iPhone mic (byte-exact to ~467 bps gross),
  AND the full loop laptop -> TAPE -> deck -> speaker -> iPhone mic -> decode (byte-exact).
- Stack: K parallel OOK carriers (1500-7000 Hz) + 7800 Hz pilot framing + periodic
  re-sync markers (tracks clock drift) + Hann demod + carrier-major interleave + Reed-Solomon.
- Tape BATCH run (71-experiment master): reliable frontier ~250 bps; most faster configs
  sit just past FEC. Acoustic readback is SNR-limited (~rms 0.03 before mic clipping).
- Bottleneck = iPhone Continuity clock drift (0.74-0.88x, sample drops) + the acoustic hop.
  Unlock = electrical line-in (Behringer UCA222/UCA222, ~EUR30) -> removes both.
- Key gotchas (see docs/acoustic_modem_lab_log.md): Dolby NR must be OFF both ends;
  record level ~7.0 (8.5 saturates -> intermod); readback speaker ~55 (rms ~0.04, no clip).
  Pre-flight LEVEL CHECKLIST SOP added (Claude prompts levels before each take).
- Tools: scripts/acoustic_ofdm_modem.py (gen/decode), acoustic_{rate_sweep,multitone_probe,
  mfsk_probe}.py, tape_batch_{gen,decode}.py. Research survey: docs/acoustic_modem_research.md.
- Next: UCA222 line-in run (full throughput frontier); DBPSK per-carrier + 2D interleave +
  cyclic prefix (predicted to clear the batch).
- Distribution note: a 3.5mm cable is enough to WRITE to tape, but NOT to READ
  (laptops/phones have no line-in; combo jack is mic-only) -> read needs acoustic (slow) or USB interface.

## Digital sprint (prior, v3)
Phase: v3 final digital sprint generated.
Verdict: do not proceed to model-payload physical prototyping; channel-validation-corrected simulation drops clean-decode below the acceptance threshold.
Best digital tuple: 16QAM 7200 sym/s, Hamming(7,4), interleaving 64, hardened modem, tiered UEP. UEP encoded TinyStories-1M size 1.271 MB, but corrected-channel Monte Carlo clean-decode is 0.075 over 80 runs.
